By leveraging the Brazilian tax system’s validation process, we ensure that each transaction is legitimate, preventing fraud and building trust with both users and businesses. This system not only enhances transparency but also boosts customer engagement, incentivizing participation through a reliable, government-backed framework.\nHow NFC-e Receipt Scanning Works Receipt Scanning: After making a purchase at a participating business, users scan their NFC-e receipt using the Pontos.Gratis app. Tax System Validation: The receipt is automatically verified against Brazil’s tax database (SEFAZ), ensuring that the purchase is valid and legitimate. Token Generation: Once validated, the system generates Business Tokens equivalent to the amount spent (e.g., BRL 100 spent results in 100 Business Tokens). User Notification: Users are immediately notified of their token balance update and can use tokens to redeem rewards, participate in promotions, or swap them for PontosReais. Integration with Brazil’s Tax System: Key Benefits Real-Time Transparency The NFC-e system enables real-time validation of every purchase through SEFAZ, guaranteeing that tokens are generated only from legitimate transactions. This ensures that every reward is tied to an actual, government-verified transaction, which builds trust with users and businesses alike.\nFraud Prevention Because each transaction is cross-checked with SEFAZ, the platform minimizes the risk of fraudulent token generation. This integration ensures that rewards cannot be manipulated, providing a fraud-resistant loyalty solution.\nSeamless Experience The receipt scanning and validation process is fully automated, creating a seamless experience for users. All they need to do is scan their NFC-e receipt, and the platform handles the rest in the background, without any interruptions to their user journey.\nReal-World Example: ZipZap Supermercados ZipZap Supermercados, a regional supermarket chain in Santa Catarina, Brazil, adopted Pontos.Gratis to enhance its loyalty program. Customers shop at any of the five ZipZap locations and scan their NFC-e receipts using the Pontos.Gratis app. Each receipt is validated through SEFAZ, and ZapCoins (ZipZap’s custom token) are generated based on the amount spent.\nKey Results Increased Trust: Customers trust that their rewards are tied to real purchases, which strengthens loyalty. Higher Engagement: The ease of earning and redeeming tokens has led to higher repeat purchase rates. Fraud Prevention: Verified receipt data ensures that ZapCoins are only generated from legitimate transactions, protecting both the business and its customers. Platform Insights and Analytics With the integration of the NFC-e system, Pontos.Gratis can track valuable data such as average spend per user, receipt scanning frequency, and customer engagement metrics. This allows businesses to tailor their loyalty programs based on real-time consumer behavior and optimize promotions to drive further engagement.\nConclusion The integration of NFC-e receipts into Pontos.Gratis offers a transparent, fraud-resistant, and user-friendly approach to earning rewards. By connecting with Brazil’s tax system, the platform ensures that every token is backed by real-world transactions, which builds trust with both users and businesses. This system not only enhances transparency but also encourages customer engagement and loyalty, providing a win-win solution for all stakeholders.\n",
