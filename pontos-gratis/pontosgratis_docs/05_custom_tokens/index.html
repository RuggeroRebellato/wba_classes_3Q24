For the first time, any business—regardless of size—can tap into the power of blockchain to fuel growth without needing specialized knowledge.\nBusiness Impact: New Revenue Streams and Growth Opportunities Custom tokens are more than just rewards; they open the door to innovative business strategies that drive growth. Here’s how businesses can benefit:\nAttract and Retain Customers: By offering branded tokens unique to their business, companies can engage customers in new ways and incentivize repeat purchases. Generate Additional Revenue: Tokens create liquidity opportunities, enabling businesses to swap tokens for PontosReais, turning customer engagement into revenue. Partner for Growth: Businesses can collaborate with others to share liquidity pools, forming alliances that broaden their reach and influence across markets. Data-Driven Growth: With access to token transaction data, businesses can analyze customer behavior, measure the effectiveness of promotions, and adjust their strategies for optimal impact. Imaginary Scenario: ZipZap Supermercados ZipZap Supermercados is a regional supermarket chain with five stores in five different cities across the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. By joining Pontos.Gratis, they’ve created a custom token called ZapCoins, which has become an integral part of their loyalty program, offering a comprehensive experience to customers across all locations.\nImplementation Steps for ZipZap Supermercados: Custom Token Creation: ZipZap generates 1 ZapCoin for every BRL spent at their stores, with the NFC-e receipt system ensuring accurate and reliable token distribution based on real-world purchases. These tokens are earned every time a customer shops at any of their five locations.\nBrand Customization: ZipZap has fully customized their token by selecting the name ZapCoins, designing a logo, and creating a distinct symbol that reflects their identity as a modern and customer-centric supermarket.\nLiquidity and Conversion: To enable customers to convert ZapCoins into PontosReais, ZipZap used the one-click liquidity pool feature to set up a trading pair. They deposited PontosReais into the pool, allowing customers and external liquidity providers to engage in token swaps while earning a share of the fees.\nCustomer Engagement: ZipZap created innovative promotions, such as offering 10,000 ZapCoins for select high-demand products. Customers can redeem ZapCoins for everyday grocery items, but they can also participate in special promotions to get exclusive deals or discounted products.\nReferral and Advocacy Programs: ZipZap also integrated the Pontos.Gratis referral system, allowing customers to earn additional ZapCoins when referring friends to shop at their stores. This system leverages social media, with customers earning rewards by sharing their experiences and referring new shoppers to ZipZap’s loyalty program.\nNFT Challenges and Rewards: ZipZap launched a series of NFT challenges, where loyal customers can earn rare digital collectibles for reaching specific milestones, like spending a certain amount in a month or visiting all five stores. These NFTs serve as both a status symbol within the ZipZap community and a collectible reward for engagement.\nGeolocation-Based Rewards: Through Pontos.Gratis’ geolocation features, ZipZap incentivized customers to check in at different locations. For example, a customer visiting three out of five stores within a month could receive bonus ZapCoins or special store discounts. This strategy has been particularly successful in driving foot traffic to less-frequented locations.\nMonitoring and Growth: ZipZap actively uses the analytics tools within Pontos.Gratis to monitor how ZapCoins and other reward programs are performing. They analyze how customers are spending tokens, track the success of NFT challenges, and adjust promotions to increase foot traffic. They also receive automated alerts when liquidity in the ZapCoins pool runs low, ensuring their token economy remains stable and functional.\nResults for ZipZap Supermercados: Increased Loyalty and Engagement: By combining custom tokens with NFTs and geolocation rewards, ZipZap has significantly increased customer loyalty and engagement, with customers frequently participating in both in-store and digital challenges. Social Advocacy and Brand Growth: ZipZap’s referral program has led to an increase in social media activity, with customers becoming advocates for the brand, sharing their experiences and referring others to join the loyalty program. Revenue Growth: ZapCoins have not only boosted customer retention but also generated additional revenue through token liquidity swaps. The data-driven approach ZipZap has adopted allows them to continuously improve their strategy, leading to a projected 15% increase in sales year-over-year. Token Creation and Customization: Tailored for Every Business Each time a customer spends BRL at a participating business, 1 Business Token is generated for every BRL spent, verified through NFC-e receipts. Businesses can fully customize the name, symbol, and branding of their tokens, making them a powerful tool for building loyalty and reinforcing brand identity. For businesses with multiple CNPJs, an economic group can be created to unify tokens under one umbrella.\nSeamless Conversion to PontosReais To convert Business Tokens to PontosReais, businesses must create a trading pair and a liquidity pool. This process is made effortless through one-click pre-configured liquidity pool templates, allowing businesses to bypass the complexities of liquidity management. All liquidity pools operate with a standard 1% fee, distributed as follows:\n0.5% to the liquidity provider. 0.5% to Pontos.Gratis. Redemption and Control: Business-Driven Flexibility Businesses have complete autonomy over how their custom tokens are redeemed. Whether it’s offering a product for a set number of tokens or establishing special promotions, the control lies entirely in the hands of the business. Pontos.Gratis does not interfere with the internal token economy but ensures that tokens are backed by real-world purchases.\nAutomated Transaction Verification for Transparency The platform automatically scrapes and verifies transaction amounts using NFC-e receipts, ensuring that tokens are consistently and accurately generated. This transparency helps build trust with customers, as the tokens are tied to real purchases and not subject to manipulation.\nRevenue from Token Swaps: A Platform Benefit When businesses or users swap Business Tokens for PontosReais, Pontos.Gratis collects a 1% fee on the transaction. This process mirrors standard decentralized and centralized exchanges, ensuring that liquidity providers are rewarded and the platform benefits from increased activity.\nMonitoring Liquidity for Stability Pontos.Gratis actively monitors liquidity pools to ensure they remain balanced. If liquidity becomes imbalanced, businesses are notified and prompted to deposit additional PontosReais into their pool, maintaining stability and preventing user dissatisfaction during token conversions.\nSupporting Business Growth with Best Practices Beyond the technical aspects, Pontos.Gratis provides educational resources to help businesses maximize the impact of their tokens. These resources focus on strategies like increasing foot traffic, creating effective promotions, and building long-term customer loyalty—all without delving into blockchain complexities.\n",
