The vault is accessible globally through the Pontos.Gratis landing page, and anyone with a Solana wallet can invest by receiving shares of the vault.\nInvestment Objective Pontos.Gratis aims to raise 1.5M USDC through Pontos.Vault, fueling fast-paced company growth and expansion. Investors deposit USDC and receive shares in the vault, representing their portion of the vault’s total value.\nFee Distribution and Structure 50% of all platform fees from token transactions, trading, and off-ramps will be allocated to the Pontos.Vault to repay investors. The remaining 50% will be used by the company for operational expenses. The vault will close to new fee contributions after 36 months, and all fund distributions will stop at that point. Vesting and Returns Pontos.Vault offers flexible vesting to encourage long-term investment, with increasing returns over time:\n6 months: 20% withdrawable 12 months: 40% withdrawable 18 months: 60% withdrawable 24 months: 80% withdrawable 30 months: 100% withdrawable 36 months: +5% bonus on total withdrawal At the end of 36 months, investors can expect returns of up to 10x their initial investment, depending on platform success and fee generation.\nRisk and Liquidity Management Investors are responsible for managing liquidity risks. If the value of the vault is lower than the amount they seek to withdraw, they will incur a loss. For example, if there are 50k MegaPontos (equivalent to 50,000 BRL) in the vault and a user has invested 10 times this amount, they will lose money if they withdraw more than available liquidity.\nPontosReais and Value Tracking PontosReais, pegged to the Brazilian Real at a 100:1 ratio (100 PontosReais = 1 BRL), are used within the vault. Investors will be able to track the value of their shares in USDC via the user interface, which will:\nShow how many shares (tokens) are minted. Display the total number of PontosReais in the vault. Calculate the value of each PontoReal in USDC based on the current exchange rate of 1 USDC = 5.60 BRL. Reselling of Shares While Pontos.Gratis will not directly facilitate or comment on secondary market activity, users may choose to resell their vault shares on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) if trading pairs for the Pontos.Vault token emerge. Once the tokens are in the client’s wallet, the user has full control over them.\n",
